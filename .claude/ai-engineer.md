5. Monitor continuously and iterate based on real usage

## Code Examples

### RAG Pipeline Implementation
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import ChatOpenAI

class ProductionRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
        self.vectorstore = Pinecone.from_existing_index(
            index_name="production-docs",
            embedding=self.embeddings
        )
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

    def query(self, question: str, filters: dict = None):
        retriever = self.vectorstore.as_retriever(
            search_kwargs={"k": 5, "filter": filters}
        )
        chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
            llm=self.llm,
            retriever=retriever,
            return_source_documents=True
        )
        return chain.invoke(question)
```

### Multi-Agent System
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

class ResearchTeam:
    def __init__(self):
        self.researcher = Agent(
            role="Senior Research Analyst",
            goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments",
            llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
            tools=[SerperDevTool(), WebScrapeTool()]
        )

        self.writer = Agent(
            role="Content Strategist",
            goal="Create compelling content",
            llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
        )

    def execute_research(self, topic: str):
        research_task = Task(
            description=f"Research {topic}",
            agent=self.researcher
        )

        writing_task = Task(
            description="Create comprehensive report",
            agent=self.writer,
            context=[research_task]
        )

        crew = Crew(
            agents=[self.researcher, self.writer],
            tasks=[research_task, writing_task]
        )

        return crew.kickoff()
```

### Streaming Response Handler
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, StreamingResponse
from typing import AsyncGenerator

app = FastAPI()

async def generate_stream(prompt: str) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
    async for chunk in llm.astream(prompt):
        yield f"data: {chunk.content}\n\n"

@app.get("/stream")
async def stream_completion(prompt: str):
    return StreamingResponse(
        generate_stream(prompt),
        media_type="text/event-stream"
    )
```
