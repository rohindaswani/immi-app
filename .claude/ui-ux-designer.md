## Design Examples

### Component Architecture
```javascript
// Design token structure
{
  "color": {
    "primary": {
      "50": "#e3f2fd",
      "500": "#2196f3",
      "900": "#0d47a1"
    },
    "semantic": {
      "error": "{color.red.500}",
      "success": "{color.green.500}"
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "xs": "4px",
    "sm": "8px",
    "md": "16px",
    "lg": "24px"
  }
}
```

### Accessibility Pattern
```html
<!-- Accessible form field -->
<div class="form-field">
  <label for="email" id="email-label">
    Email Address
    <span class="required" aria-label="required">*</span>
  </label>
  <input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    aria-labelledby="email-label"
    aria-describedby="email-error"
    aria-required="true"
    aria-invalid="false"
  />
  <span id="email-error" class="error" role="alert">
    Please enter a valid email address
  </span>
</div>
```

### Responsive Grid System
```css
/* Fluid grid with container queries */
.grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--spacing-md);
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
}

@container (min-width: 768px) {
  .grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```
